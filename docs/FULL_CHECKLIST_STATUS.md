# Takhet+ Full Backend Checklist Status (excluding delivery + home visit by decision)

## Scope note
- Per current product decision, **home visit** and **delivery** blocks are intentionally excluded from current implementation scope.

## A) What is already implemented (or scaffolded strongly)
- Identity/Auth/Roles/JWT guards + role guards.
- Partner/doctor/patient/admin role endpoints.
- Case lifecycle with payout condition coupling.
- Clinic scope in doctor/case/payment and partner-scoped access model.
- Triage AI baseline and AI storage tables.
- Documents/signatures/RTC signaling + token generation baseline.
- Payments + webhook + idempotency baseline + 70/10/20 split + hold.
- Audit/notifications and core EMR storage primitives.

## B) What I can implement now without your further decisions (fast path)
1. Add cron worker to move `hold -> ready_for_payout` automatically.
2. Add admin payout UI/backend safeguards (double-check windows, dry-run endpoint).
3. Add partner analytics endpoints fully clinic-scoped (commission trends, payout backlog).
4. Add e2e smoke tests for core flow (auth -> case -> paid -> consultation_finished -> earning).
5. Add stricter DB constraints/indexes and migration split files.

## C) What I can implement, but it needs more time (medium effort)
1. Full EMR write/read APIs per section (diagnoses/symptoms/vitals/labs/imaging/procedures/family).
2. Complete consultation domain (chat history APIs, revisit API, urgent queue controls).
3. Subscription/package/installment business logic with billing states.
4. Doctor collaboration workflows (doctor_consultations/expert_reviews) with RBAC.
5. Advanced AI overlays (risk trajectories, doctor-assist drafts) with auditability.

## D) What I cannot complete correctly without your explicit operational/legal inputs
1. **Real EDS (NCALayer/NCA RK)** legal-signature lifecycle.
2. Final legal document taxonomy: mandatory vs optional signed artifacts at launch.
3. Production RLS matrix approval for partner/admin edge-cases.
4. External integrations contracts (labs/pharmacy/insurance): API specs and credentials.
5. Financial operations policy: payout cutoffs, reversal windows, dispute handling.

## E) Exactly what I need from you now
1. EDS policy decisions:
   - which docs are legally mandatory signed at launch (`report`, `prescription`, etc.)
   - signature format + provider constraints (CMS/PKCS7 and verification rules)
2. Ops payout policy:
   - weekly payout day/time, timezone, reversal authority and deadline
3. Security governance:
   - final partner/admin visibility matrix for RLS in production
4. Integration access:
   - staging credentials and API docs for lab/insurance/pharmacy partners
5. Data governance:
   - retention policy for medical docs/chat/audit and deletion policy
